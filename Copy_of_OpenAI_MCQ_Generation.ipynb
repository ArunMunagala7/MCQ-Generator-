It ensures convergence with various \\nprogrammes i.e., Anganwadi Services, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), Scheme \\nfor Adolescent Girls (SAG) of MWCD Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), National He alth Mission \\n(NHM), Swachh -Bharat Mission, Public Distribution System (PDS), Department Food & Public \\nDistribution, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and \\nMinistry of Drinking Water & Sanitation . \\nWay Forward  \\n\\uf0b7 Improved traini ng should be given to Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) & ASHA workers along with \\nAnganwadi workers . \\n\\uf0b7 Farmers must be given adequate knowledge about diverse and nutritious crops that can be grown in \\naddition to traditional crops like cereals . \\n\\uf0b7 Mid-day meals must  be designed based on local culture and geography and greater flexibility must \\nbe given to states to design interventions based on regional conditions   ', metadata={'source': '/content/Nutrition-and-India.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
